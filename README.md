# Spring Boot & Angular App

Backend part of Full Stack Application: Angular and Java Spring Boot 

Frontend part: 
https://github.com/kubaokleja/spring-boot-angular-frontend

## Goals

The main goal was to learn angular and connect it with spring boot backend.

I decided to learn by coding. 
Additionally, I wanted to enhance my knowledge about Spring Security. 

## About

Application doesn't have any specific name because I would like to try few different things which are not connected with each other from the business perspective. 

I'm aware of my limitations like css styling. I'd like to improve it in the future, but for now I want to focus more on Angular & Spring Boot and try to do many different things to develop as a programmer.
