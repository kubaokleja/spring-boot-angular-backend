# Spring Boot & Angular App

Backend part of Full Stack Application: Angular and Java Spring Boot 

Frontend part: 
https://github.com/kubaokleja/spring-boot-angular-frontend

## Goals

The main goal was to learn angular and connect it with spring boot backend.

I decided to learn by coding. 
Additionally, I wanted to enhance my knowledge about Spring Security. 

## About

Application doesn't have any specific name because I would like to try few different things which are not connected with each other from the business perspective. 
I decided to package classes by domain and communicate between domains only by using their facades. Thanks to that I am able to provide better encapsulation.
I'm aware of my limitations like css styling. I'd like to improve it in the future, but for now I want to focus more on Angular & Spring Boot and try to do many different things to develop as a programmer. This is why also some edge cases are not considered.
